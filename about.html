              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>It remains difficult... Presenting yourself beautifully, but also being honest about what your
                flaws are. Keeping a possible bright future in mind, without losing yourself. Or
                am I thinking too difficult? Should I let go and let the world come towards me? Am I 'strong' enough
                to explore the world, and even develop myself in it? </p>

              <p>These are all questions that are in the back of my mind every day. And the only way to find out the
                answers to these questions is to work hard. For me, 'working hard' means letting go of the aspect of
                'being active when I feel like it' and taking an active attitude within my work process. “But who
                are you?” You may ask yourself</p>

              <h3>Who Is Joey?</h3>
              <p>On October 26, 2023, Joey van der Linden signed his propaedeutic certificate, and he knew for sure:
                'I am going to work hard to make something out of this.' Joey has been fascinated by everything related
                to technology since his childhood. From computer technology, to the art of cinematography. </p>

              <p>Joey also
                grew up during the period of time when many different subcultures and technological developments
                began to
                integrate within society. Society adapted to keep up with these major developments, and so did Joey. He
                didn't know what he
                wanted to be when he grew up. The world was big, especially for a little high school student who had
                to start making choices early on about his future, so what will it be?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
              <h3>What is Joey Capable of?</h3>
              <p>Joey wanted to try everything media has to offer. From Virtual Reality
                development within a company based at a secondary school, to multimedia design and project
                management as a Bachelor. </p>

              <p> Joey wanted to taste everything first before deciding which direction he
                wanted
                to look. “And which way are you looking now?” You ask yourself.
                Everything related to capturing images and shaping them has interested me from an early age. On July
                27, 2022 I bought my very first SLR camera, the Canon 7D. I developed an addiction for photography,
                and later wanted to take the leap into videography.</p>

              <h3>Joey's Personal Goals</h3>
              <p>Impact, that is important to me. I want to add value to the world through my work. This could be a
                wonderful documentary that addresses a social problem, but it could also be a film that receives a lot
                of respect within the media industry. My own mass media production product is therefore a good
                prospect, and something I want to work towards. Now I just
                got to meet the right people who will help me achieve that. But I'm not worried, otherwise
                you wouldn't read this article to the end; ).</p>
